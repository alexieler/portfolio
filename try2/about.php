        <div id="about-para">
                <p>Salut, I’m <strong>Alexie</strong> - a sarcastic source of energy, a curious adventurer and a life long learner. Oh and I also love all things web.</p>
                <p>I currently live in Toronto, where I’m pursuing a degree in web development so I can go on to help create useful and meaningful digital experiences.<p>
                <p>I love working outside of my comfort zone and rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, both abstract or concrete.</p>   
                <p>I’m a team player that wholeheartedly believes in the power of collaboration. Innovation is a team sport and nowhere is this more embraced than in the tech sector.<p> 
                <p>I'm also interested in becoming apart of the movement to democratize technology education. I volunteer with Canada Learning Code where I work as a Toronto Chapter Coordinator. I want to help empower all Canadians, particularly women, with the knowledge and confidence to harness the power of technology.</p>

                    <h3>What does the world need more of:</h3>
                    <p> I read somewhere that the world needs more people with hobbies. I think this is so true because this statement is easier said than done. Hobbies requires things like free time, space, money to spend freely on something as simple as your own happiness. Those are luxuries for the majority of people in this world. But the effects of incorporating activities and experiences in our lives that simply bring us joy is so incredibly beneficial to our sense of pride, confidence and wellbeing.</p>
