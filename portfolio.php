                I created all the images and sprites of the game (including a little mini me running around). <a target="_blank" href="https://alexieler.github.io/gameboy/" class="text-link">Check it out to experience a wave of nostalgia!</a></p></div>

                <div class="portfolio-para secondary-para" id="zombie-para"><p>I created a zombie apocalypse themed restaurant as a group project. I worked as the lead designer where I helped come up with the concept, colour scheme and created the illustrations and animations (minus the logo). I was responsible for the <strong>landing page, the loading animation, the about us page and the memory matching game </strong>. 
                I've linked the entire website and this site would not have been possible without my awesome teammates. Despite the fact that responsiveness was not a priority for our grade I ensured that my pages were mobile friendly. <a target="_blank" href="https://alexieler.github.io/zombie-apocalypse/" class="text-link"> Explore it here.</a></p></div>
